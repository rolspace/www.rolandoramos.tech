Our first winter in Zurich is almost here. Little by little the clouds have taken over and temperature has been dropping gradually in the past few weeks.

September and October were quite good in terms of temperature and sunshine. Unlike August, which was the anti-Summer: lots of cloudy days and lots of rain.

Things have clearly changed in December, where we've had a few days with near 0 degree temperatures, or less. There has been no snow yet, but hopefully some will fall when winter gets going for good.

At the beginning of November, I had a chance to go up to the Uetliberg's summit on a Sunday afternoon without the need to wear a heavy jacket. It's great that only a 30 minute hike takes you all the way to the top, and you get a great view of the city. Thanks to the good weather there were tons of people around and enjoying themselves.

I'll be coming back here many more times I hope.
